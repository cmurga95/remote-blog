### Attendance and lead report
https://github.com/cmurga95/chapelhillbjj
This project automates the extraction, transformation, and reporting of member attendance data from a PushPress Looker dashboard.
It demonstrates how to build a full-stack data pipeline, leveraging automation, cloud database engineering, and interactive dashboards to generate actionable business insights. I originally used fastAPI to manage CRUD operations, but since I am hosting the app in render's free tier I had to use 2 services, which caused a delay. I opted to use SupaBase-py and keep everything in a single service.

### Bar path tracker
Bar path tracker using machine learning vision tools. Designed to analyze performance and results over time from weight training.
